# sachi
An (experimental) map editor for neo. `sachi` aims to be the go-to tool when editing maps of neo projects.
While the editor is still in its very early stages, displaying maps and (very) basic map editing is already possible.

### Building

`sachi` is built using Gtk4 and its C++ interface gtkmm-4.0. On Linux, after having installed the necessary dependencies, 
you can build `sachi` via a simple `make`. More detailled instructions and instructions for other OS follow once `sachi` becomes ready for use.
